Update to the default Genesis Featured Post widget to allow excluding categories.

== Description ==
The default Genesis Featured Post widget is great, except you only have the option to include All categories or a specific category. You can exclude previously displayed posts or "sticky" posts, but you can't exclude all posts in a specific category.

This plugin was created out of a need to show all but one category in the featured post widget.
